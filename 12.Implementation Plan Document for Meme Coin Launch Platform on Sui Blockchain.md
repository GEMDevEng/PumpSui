## 2. Project Overview

The Meme Coin Launch Platform is a web-based dApp that allows users to create and trade meme coins on the Sui blockchain, inspired by Pump.fun. It leverages Sui’s high-performance architecture and Move programming language to provide instant token creation, bonding curve trading, automatic liquidity pool setup on Cetus DEX, a creator dashboard, trending/leaderboard sections, burn mechanics, and wallet integration. The MVP aims to deliver a secure, scalable, and user-friendly experience.

### 2.1 Key Features
- **Token Creation**: Create meme coins with customizable parameters.
- **Bonding Curve Trading**: Buy/sell coins with dynamic pricing.
- **Automatic Liquidity Pool Setup**: Transition coins to Cetus DEX at a market cap threshold.
- **Creator Dashboard**: Analytics and metadata management for creators.
- **Trending and Leaderboard**: Highlight popular coins and creators.
- **Burn Mechanics**: Reduce token supply under specific conditions.
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect Sui-compatible wallets.

### 2.2 Success Criteria
- Deliver MVP within the planned timeline (12 weeks).
- Achieve sub-second transaction confirmations and <2-second page loads.
- Pass security audits for smart contracts and frontend.
- Support 1,000 concurrent users with 99.9% uptime.
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility compliance.

## 3. Implementation Strategy

### 3.1 Development Approach
- **Agile Methodology**: Use 2-week sprints with daily stand-ups and bi-weekly reviews.
- **Modular Development**: Divide work into frontend, smart contracts, backend/indexer, and integrations.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementing features to ensure reliability.
- **Continuous Integration**: Automate testing and deployment with GitHub Actions.
- **Security First**: Prioritize smart contract audits and secure coding practices.

### 3.2 Phased Implementation
The project is divided into four phases: Planning, Development, Testing, and Deployment.

#### Phase 1: Planning (Weeks 1-2)
- Define requirements, architecture, and tech stack.
- Set up development environment and CI/CD pipelines.
- Assign tasks and establish team roles.

#### Phase 2: Development (Weeks 3-8)
- Implement core features in parallel (frontend, smart contracts, backend/indexer).
- Conduct iterative testing and code reviews.
- Integrate with Sui blockchain and Cetus DEX.

#### Phase 3: Testing (Weeks 9-10)
- Perform unit, integration, security, and performance testing.
- Conduct usability testing with target audience segments.
- Address bugs and refine features.

#### Phase 4: Deployment (Weeks 11-12)
- Deploy to Sui testnet for final validation.
- Launch on Sui mainnet and Vercel/AWS.
- Monitor post-launch performance and user feedback.

### 3.3 Risk Management
- **Risk**: Smart contract vulnerabilities
  - **Mitigation**: Conduct third-party audits and use Move’s type safety.
- **Risk**: Sui blockchain instability
  - **Mitigation**: Test on testnet and monitor network status.
- **Risk**: Delayed DEX integration
  - **Mitigation**: Use Cetus SDK early and plan for Turbos as a fallback.
- **Risk**: Team bandwidth constraints
  - **Mitigation**: Prioritize MVP features and outsource non-critical tasks.
