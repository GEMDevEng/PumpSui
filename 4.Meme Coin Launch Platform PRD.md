# Product Overview
The Meme Coin Launch Platform is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Sui blockchain, enabling users to create, launch, and trade meme coins seamlessly. Utilizing Sui’s high-performance architecture and Move programming language, it offers instant token creation, bonding curve trading, and automatic liquidity pool integration with Sui DEXes.

# User Flows

### Token Creation Flow
1. User connects their Sui wallet.
2. User navigates to "Create Coin."
3. User fills in coin details: name, symbol, image, initial supply, bonding curve parameters, royalty fee, etc.
4. User reviews the information.
5. User confirms and pays the creation fee in SUI.
6. Platform deploys the smart contract on Sui.
7. Coin is listed on the platform's market.

### Trading Flow
1. User connects their wallet.
2. User browses or searches for a meme coin.
3. User selects a coin and views its details.
4. User chooses to buy or sell.
5. For buying:
   - User enters the amount of SUI to spend.
   - Platform calculates the number of tokens to receive.
   - User confirms the transaction.
   - Platform executes the purchase.
6. For selling:
   - User enters the amount of tokens to sell.
   - Platform calculates the SUI to receive.
   - User confirms.
   - Platform executes the sale.

### Automatic Liquidity Pool Setup
1. Platform monitors the market cap of each meme coin.
2. When a coin's market cap reaches the threshold (e.g., $69,000), the platform triggers liquidity pool creation.
3. Platform interacts with the Sui DEX’s smart contracts to create a new pool.
4. Platform adds initial liquidity using tokens and SUI.
5. Coin is listed on the DEX, and trading continues there.

# Features and Functionality

- **Token Creation**
  - Frontend form collects details; smart contract in Move deploys the token.
- **Bonding Curve Trading**
  - Smart contract calculates prices based on supply; buy/sell functions execute trades.
- **Automatic Liquidity Pool Setup**
  - Platform integrates with Sui DEX contracts to create pools when thresholds are met.
- **Analytics**
  - Data fetched from blockchain or indexer; displayed via frontend charts.
- **Wallet Integration**
  - Sui wallet adapters enable transaction signing and balance display.

# Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript, using Sui wallet adapters.
- **Smart Contracts**: Written in Move, deployed on Sui blockchain.
- **Indexer**: Custom service for blockchain event tracking.
- **Backend (Optional)**: Node.js for off-chain logic and APIs.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for off-chain data.

# System Design

- **Frontend**: Handles UI and user interactions, communicates with wallet and blockchain.
- **Smart Contracts**: Manages token creation, trading, and DEX integration.
- **Indexer**: Listens to blockchain events, updates database.
- **Database**: Stores indexed data for quick frontend access.
- **Backend (if used)**: Serves APIs for off-chain data retrieval.

# API Specifications
Since most interactions are blockchain-based, a backend is optional. If implemented:

- **GET /api/coins**
  - Purpose: List all meme coins.
  - Response: `{ id, name, symbol, marketCap }[]`
- **GET /api/coins/{id}**
  - Purpose: Get coin details.
  - Response: `{ id, name, symbol, price, volume, holders }`
- **GET /api/transactions/{coinId}**
  - Purpose: Get transaction history.
  - Response: `{ id, type, amount, price, timestamp }[]`

# Data Model

- **MemeCoin**
  - `id: string`
  - `name: string`
  - `symbol: string`
  - `image: string`
  - `creator: address`
  - `totalSupply: number`
  - `currentSupply: number`
  - `marketCap: number`
  - `isListedOnDex: boolean`

- **User**
  - `address: string`
  - `createdCoins: array of MemeCoin ids`
  - `holdings: map of MemeCoin id to amount`

- **Transaction**
  - `id: string`
  - `coinId: string`
  - `type: 'buy' | 'sell'`
  - `amount: number`
  - `price: number`
  - `timestamp: date`

**Relationships**: A User can create multiple MemeCoins; a MemeCoin has multiple Transactions.

# Security Considerations

- **Smart Contract Audits**: Test and audit contracts to prevent exploits.
- **Frontend Security**: Protect against XSS and CSRF attacks.
- **Access Control**: Restrict metadata updates to coin creators.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent transaction or API abuse.

# Performance Requirements

- **Transaction Speed**: Sub-second confirmations via Sui.
- **Page Load Times**: Under 2 seconds.
- **API Response Times**: Under 200ms for critical endpoints.

# Scalability Considerations

- Utilize Sui’s parallel transaction processing.
- Optimize database queries and implement caching.
- Design backend for horizontal scaling if needed.

# Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: For smart contracts (Move framework) and frontend components.
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end flows (e.g., coin creation, trading).
- **Security Audits**: For smart contracts.
- **Load Testing**: Simulate high traffic.

# Deployment Plan

1. Deploy smart contracts to Sui testnet.
2. Set up frontend on staging server.
3. Conduct thorough testing.
4. Deploy smart contracts to Sui mainnet.
5. Launch frontend on production hosting (e.g., Vercel).
6. Configure indexer and backend if used.
7. Monitor post-launch.

# Maintenance and Support
