## 4. Architecture Overview

The platform follows a client-serverless architecture with the following components:
- **Frontend**: React.js application hosted on Vercel, interacting with Sui blockchain and wallets.
- **Smart Contracts**: Move contracts deployed on Sui, handling token creation, trading, and DEX integration.
- **Indexer**: Node.js service on AWS/GCP, listening to Sui events and storing data in PostgreSQL.
- **Backend (Optional)**: Node.js/Express server for off-chain APIs, hosted on AWS/GCP.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on AWS RDS, storing indexed data for quick retrieval.
- **Integrations**: Sui Wallet Adapter for wallet connections, Cetus SDK for DEX interactions.

**Data Flow**:
1. User interacts with the frontend, connecting their wallet via Sui Wallet Adapter.
2. Frontend sends transactions to Sui blockchain via Sui JavaScript SDK.
3. Smart contracts process transactions (e.g., token creation, trades).
4. Indexer listens to blockchain events via WebSocket API and updates PostgreSQL.
5. Frontend queries indexed data directly or via optional backend APIs.
6. For LP setup, smart contracts interact with Cetus DEX.

## 5. Security Considerations

- **Smart Contracts**: Use Move’s type safety and audit contracts with tools like [Move Prover](https://docs.sui.io/).
- **Frontend**: Protect against XSS/CSRF with React’s built-in safeguards and secure headers.
- **Backend/Indexer**: Implement rate limiting and authentication for APIs.
- **Wallet Integration**: Use secure adapters to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Data Privacy**: Store minimal user data; rely on blockchain for transaction records.

## 6. Scalability Considerations

- **Blockchain**: Leverage Sui’s parallel transaction processing for high throughput.
- **Frontend**: Vercel’s serverless architecture scales automatically.
- **Indexer/Backend**: Use AWS/GCP auto-scaling groups for horizontal scaling.
- **Database**: Optimize PostgreSQL with indexing and caching (e.g., Redis for hot data).
- **Load Balancing**: Implement AWS Elastic Load Balancer for backend traffic.

## 7. Development Workflow

### 7.1 Setup
1. Clone repository from GitHub.
2. Install Node.js, npm, and Sui CLI.
3. Set up PostgreSQL locally or on AWS RDS.
4. Install frontend dependencies: `npm install`.
5. Configure environment variables (e.g., Sui RPC URL, Cetus API keys).

### 7.2 Development
- Frontend: Run `npm run dev` with Vite for hot reloading.
- Smart Contracts: Write Move code, test with Sui CLI, deploy to testnet.
- Indexer: Develop Node.js service, connect to Sui WebSocket API.
- Backend (if used): Build Express APIs, integrate with PostgreSQL.

### 7.3 CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions**:
  - Lint and test on pull requests.
  - Build and deploy frontend to Vercel on main branch merges.
  - Deploy indexer/backend to AWS/GCP.
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Manual deployment to testnet/mainnet via Sui CLI, automated in future iterations.

## 8. Constraints and Dependencies

### 8.1 Constraints
- Smart contracts must use Move and adhere to Sui’s object-centric model.
- No local file I/O for potential Pyodide-based components.
- Frontend must support Sui wallet adapters for transaction signing.

### 8.2 Dependencies
- **Sui SDK**: For blockchain interactions and contract deployment.
- **Cetus SDK**: For DEX integration.
- **Sui Wallet Adapter**: For wallet connections.
- **AWS/GCP**: For hosting indexer, backend, and database.
- **Vercel**: For frontend hosting.

## 9. Alternatives Considered

### 9.1 Frontend Framework
- **Alternative**: Vue.js
  - **Reason Not Chosen**: Smaller ecosystem and less community support compared to React.js.

### 9.2 Database
- **Alternative**: MongoDB
  - **Reason Not Chosen**: Relational structure of PostgreSQL better suits structured coin and transaction data.

### 9.3 Hosting
- **Alternative**: Netlify
  - **Reason Not Chosen**: Vercel offers better integration with React and CI/CD workflows.

### 9.4 DEX Integration
- **Alternative**: Turbos
  - **Reason Not Chosen**: Cetus has more mature APIs in MVP phase; Turbos planned for future iterations.
