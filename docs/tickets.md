# Tickets Document for Meme Coin Launch Platform on Sui Blockchain

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Tickets Document provides a comprehensive list of tickets (issues) required to develop, test, and deploy the Meme Coin Launch Platform, a decentralized application (dApp) on the Sui blockchain. Each ticket represents a specific task or issue, including detailed descriptions, acceptance criteria, deliverables, estimated effort, dependencies, assignees, priorities, and timelines. The document serves as a centralized reference for developers, project managers, and stakeholders to track progress, ensure accountability, and deliver the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within a 12-week timeline.

### 1.2 Scope
The tickets cover all activities for the MVP of the Meme Coin Launch Platform, including frontend development, smart contract implementation, optional backend/indexer setup, integrations with Sui wallets and Cetus DEX, testing, documentation, and deployment. The tickets align with the platform’s core features: token creation, bonding curve trading, automatic liquidity pool setup, creator dashboard, trending/leaderboard sections, burn mechanics, and wallet integration. The document is designed to be managed via GitHub Issues for task tracking.

- Smart contracts must use Move and Sui’s object-centric model.
- Frontend must integrate with Sui Wallet Adapter.
- Backend APIs must support 1,000 concurrent users.
- Project timeline is fixed at 12 weeks.

## 8. Dependencies

- Frontend tickets (FD-07 to FD-12) depend on smart contract (SD-01 to SD-12) and backend (BD-07 to BD-09) data.
- Backend/indexer tickets (BD-04 to BD-06) rely on smart contract events.
- Testing tickets (TS-01 to TS-09) require completed features.
- Deployment tickets (DP-01 to DP-08) depend on successful testing.

## 9. Ticket Management

- **Platform**: GitHub Issues
- **Workflow**:
  - Create tickets with detailed descriptions and acceptance criteria.
  - Assign tickets to team members based on expertise.
  - Use labels to categorize tickets (`feature`, `bug`, `test`, `documentation`, etc.).
  - Link tickets to PRs for tracking.
  - Close tickets after PR merge and QA verification.
- **Review Process**:
  - Require two approvals for PRs.
  - Ensure tests pass and acceptance criteria are met.
  - Update ticket status in GitHub.
