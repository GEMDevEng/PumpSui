# Gantt Chart Document for Meme Coin Launch Platform on Sui Blockchain

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Gantt Chart Document provides a detailed and comprehensive timeline for the development, testing, and deployment of the Meme Coin Launch Platform, a decentralized application (dApp) on the Sui blockchain. The Gantt chart visualizes tasks, durations, dependencies, and milestones over a 12-week project timeline, ensuring clarity and alignment for developers, project managers, and stakeholders. It serves as a scheduling tool to track progress, manage resources, and deliver the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) on time.

### 1.2 Scope
The Gantt chart covers all tasks required to build the MVP of the Meme Coin Launch Platform, including frontend development, smart contract implementation, optional backend/indexer setup, integrations with Sui wallets and Cetus DEX, testing, documentation, and deployment. The chart aligns with the platform’s core features: token creation, bonding curve trading, automatic liquidity pool setup, creator dashboard, trending/leaderboard sections, burn mechanics, and wallet integration. The timeline spans from May 5, 2025, to July 27, 2025.

## 2. Project Overview

The Meme Coin Launch Platform is a web-based dApp that enables users to create, launch, and trade meme coins on the Sui blockchain, inspired by Pump.fun. It leverages Sui’s high-performance architecture and Move programming language to deliver a secure, scalable, and user-friendly experience. The MVP includes features such as token creation, bonding curve trading, automatic liquidity pool setup on Cetus DEX, a creator dashboard, trending/leaderboard sections, burn mechanics, and wallet integration, targeting crypto enthusiasts, meme creators, developers, investors, and newcomers.

### 2.1 Key Objectives
- Deliver MVP by July 27, 2025 (12 weeks).
- Ensure sub-second transaction confirmations and <2-second page loads.
- Pass security audits for smart contracts and frontend.
- Support 1,000 concurrent users with 99.9% uptime.
- Achieve WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility compliance.

## 3. Gantt Chart Overview

The Gantt chart is organized by project phases and categories: Project Management, Environment Setup, Frontend Development, Smart Contract Development, Backend/Indexer Development, Integrations, Testing, Documentation, Deployment, and Post-Launch Support. Each task includes:

- **Task ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., PM-01).
- **Task Name**: Descriptive title of the task.
- **Start Date**: Planned start date.
- **End Date**: Planned completion date.
- **Duration**: Number of calendar days.
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisite tasks.
- **Assignee**: Role or team member responsible.
- **Milestone**: Key deliverables or checkpoints.

The chart assumes a 5-day workweek (Monday to Friday) and accounts for dependencies to ensure a realistic schedule. Tasks are grouped into six sprints, each lasting two weeks, from May 5, 2025, to July 27, 2025.

## 6. Resource Allocation

- **Project Manager**: 24 days (PM-01 to PM-08, DC-01, DC-03, PL-03)
- **Frontend Developers (2)**:
  - Frontend Developer 1: 30 days (FD-01, FD-04, FD-05, FD-07, FD-09, FD-11, FD-13, IN-01, IN-02, DP-02, DP-05)
  - Frontend Developer 2: 30 days (FD-03, FD-06, FD-08, FD-10, FD-12, FD-14)
- **Smart Contract Developers (2)**:
  - Smart Contract Developer 1: 25 days (SD-01, SD-02, SD-04, SD-06, SD-08, SD-10, SD-12, DP-01, DP-04)
  - Smart Contract Developer 2: 25 days (SD-03, SD-05, SD-07, SD-09, SD-11, TS-03)
- **Backend Developer**: 40 days (BD-01 to BD-12, IN-03, IN-04, DP-03, DP-06, DP-08, DC-02)

- **Security Auditor (External)**: 5 days (TS-06)
- **Total Effort**: 276 person-days

## 7. Assumptions

- Team members are proficient in TypeScript, React.js, Node.js, and Move.
- Sui blockchain and Cetus DEX APIs are stable and accessible.
- External security audit can be completed within 5 days.
- Usability testing participants are available during Week 9.

## 8. Constraints

- Smart contracts must use Move and Sui’s object-centric model.
- Frontend must integrate with Sui Wallet Adapter.
- Backend APIs must support 1,000 concurrent users.
- Project timeline is fixed at 12 weeks (May 5, 2025 - July 27, 2025).

## 9. Dependencies

- Frontend tasks (FD-07 to FD-12) depend on smart contract (SD-01 to SD-12) and backend (BD-07 to BD-09) data.
- Backend/indexer tasks (BD-04 to BD-06) rely on smart contract events.
- Testing tasks (TS-01 to TS-09) require completed features.
- Deployment tasks (DP-01 to DP-08) depend on successful testing.
