# Software Requirements Specification for Meme Coin Launch Platform on Sui Blockchain

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Meme Coin Launch Platform, a decentralized application (dApp) on the Sui blockchain. The platform enables users to create, launch, and trade meme coins, integrating with Sui-based decentralized exchanges (DEXes) like Cetus or Turbos. This document serves as a guide for developers, testers, and stakeholders to ensure the system meets its intended functionality, performance, and security goals.

## 14. Appendix

### 14.1 Sample Bonding Curve Formula
- Price = InitialPrice + (Slope * TokensPurchased)
- Example: InitialPrice = 0.001 SUI, Slope = 0.0001, TokensPurchased = 1000
- Price = 0.001 + (0.0001 * 1000) = 0.101 SUI per token

### 14.2 Sample Smart Contract Structure (Move)
```move
module MemeCoin {
    struct Coin has key {
        id: UID,
        name: String,
        symbol: String,
        total_supply: u64,
        current_supply: u64,
        creator: address,
    }

    public fun create_coin(name: String, symbol: String, supply: u64, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```
