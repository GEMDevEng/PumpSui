The MVP includes features such as token creation, bonding curve trading, automatic liquidity pool setup on Cetus DEX, a creator dashboard, trending/leaderboard sections, burn mechanics, and wallet integration, targeting crypto enthusiasts, meme creators, developers, investors, and newcomers.

### 2.1 Key Objectives
- Deliver MVP within 12 weeks.
- Ensure sub-second transaction confirmations and <2-second page loads.
- Pass security audits for smart contracts and frontend.
- Support 1,000 concurrent users with 99.9% uptime.
- Achieve WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility compliance.
